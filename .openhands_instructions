This is a Python repo for openhands-resolver, a library that attempts to resolve github issues with the AI agent OpenHands.

- Setup: `poetry install --with test --with dev`
- Testing: Tests can be run with `poetry run pytest tests/test_*.py`. All new tests should be written in pytest conventions (not unittest).
- Linting: Linting is done according to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, and should be done before making commits.
- Version bumping: When bumping the version, update both `openhands_resolver/__init__.py` and `pyproject.toml`.
